Skincare is (Skin)Caring

(image here)

For some, skincare is a chore. But for some others, skincare is a hobby… albeit an expensive one. With that, comes the piles of free samples that more often than not, end up unused. This results in a huge inventory of (unused) products at the back of our cabinets, and what better way is there than to spread the love and pass it on to someone else who wants it?

SI(S)C, an abbreviation of Sharing is (Skin)Caring, aims to be a local skincare community inspired by subreddits like AsianBeauty, SkincareAddiction, SkincareExchange and etc., where users can safely sell, give away unwanted samples, request and even provide reviews.

### You may ask, Why SI(S)C even though platforms like Carousell exists?
Inspired by Carousell’s selling & ‘looking for’ system, I personally would feel safer knowing that the person I’m purchasing from has the same interest as me and is genuine. Plus, I won’t have to filter through a lot of different categories to reach the skincare section.

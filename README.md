For some, skincare is a chore. But for some others, skincare is a hobby… albeit an expensive one. With that, comes the piles of free samples that more often than not, end up unused. This results in a huge inventory of (unused) products at the back of our cabinets, and what better way is there than to spread the love and pass it on to someone else who wants it?

SI(S)C, an abbreviation of Sharing is (Skin)Caring, aims to be a local skincare community inspired by subreddits like AsianBeauty, SkincareAddiction, SkincareExchange and etc., where users can safely sell, give away unwanted samples, request and even provide reviews.

**You may ask, Why SI(S)C even though platforms like Carousell exists?**

Inspired by Carousell’s selling & ‘looking for’ system, I personally would feel safer knowing that the person I’m purchasing from has the same interest as me and is genuine. Plus, I won’t have to filter through a lot of different categories to reach the skincare section.

**As the site owner, I want to:**
- build a safe community for local skincare enthusiasts
- allow users to interact, sell, request and provide reviews(which will be especially helpful since we're all living in the same country and experiencing the same weather!)

**As the end user, I want to:**
- be a part of a local skincare community
- sell or give away unwanted samples or products
- request for products
- contribute reviews on products I've tried before

## UI/UX
(flow/sitemap here)

**Inspiration:** I find myself going back to look at [Glossier](https://www.glossier.com/) and [Good Molecules](https://www.goodmolecules.com/)’ websites quite frequently. More often than not, I do so just out of pure liking for the UI and not to actually browse the actual catalogs. The harmony of the colours, and layouts and modern UI are pleasing to look at.

### Wireframes
[Here](https://www.figma.com/file/th9IcPkY20TucZrka24hoT/Skincare-UI?node-id=0%3A1) are the wireframes for the website. Colours used here are not finalised.

### Colours
The colours used in the wireframes are mainly shades of grey and pink, but I decided to change it up a bit because pink adds a touch of femininity to the branding, which is not what I'm going for.

**SI(S)C uses:**
- Gender-neutral colours (black, white, and mediumslateblue as the accent colour) because skincare is for everyone, regardless of genders!
- The retro line design to give it an element of fun

### Font
Font used: [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope?preview.text_type=custom&preview.text=A)

It's not too sharp or playful, and works great as both headers and body text. Very modern-looking.
